# Mantle Global Hackathon 2025 - Submission

## Project: AI-Powered RWA Risk Analyzer

### One-Line Description
An AI-driven platform for evaluating tokenized real-world assets with comprehensive risk scoring, oracle data integration, and personalized investment recommendations.

---

## Problem Statement

The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is rapidly growing, with projections reaching $16 trillion by 2030. However, investors face significant challenges:

1. **Lack of Standardized Risk Assessment**: No unified framework for evaluating RWA projects
2. **Information Asymmetry**: Difficulty accessing and analyzing project fundamentals
3. **Technical Complexity**: Understanding tokenomics, compliance, and smart contracts
4. **Limited Due Diligence Tools**: No AI-powered analysis specifically for RWAs

---

## Solution

The RWA Risk Analyzer provides:

### AI-Powered Analysis
- GPT-5 integration for intelligent project evaluation
- Analysis of financials, team, market, compliance, and technology
- Automated scoring on a 0-100 scale

### Comprehensive Risk Framework
Five-category scoring system:
- Financial Health
- Team Credibility
- Market Viability
- Regulatory Compliance
- Technical Implementation

### Personalized Recommendations
- Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive profiles
- Portfolio allocation suggestions
- Action-oriented guidance (Buy/Hold/Sell)

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Risk change alerts
- Market data integration
- Oracle price feeds
